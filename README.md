# About

It is a messy, ugly-looking, but yet useful (at least for the author) planner for bikepacking trips.
It can compute shortest routes from A to B, take into the account daily chores (like shopping or laundry),
so once you load your plan into [TrackRadar](https://github.com/macias/TrackRadar) you can relax and focus on
the views (unless it is uphill of course).

# Building

You will need:
* [forked Blazor Leaflet](https://github.com/macias/BlazorLeaflet) as an external project,
* [TrackRadar libraries](https://github.com/macias/TrackRadar) as nugets,
* [Gpx libraries](https://github.com/macias/Gpx) as nugets,

and you will need running [Mapnik](https://mapnik.org/).
