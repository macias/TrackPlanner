# About

It is a messy, ugly-looking, but yet useful (at least for the author) planner for bikepacking trips.
It can compute shortest routes from A to B, take into the account daily chores (like shopping or laundry),
so once you load your plan into [TrackRadar](https://github.com/macias/TrackRadar) you can relax and focus on
the views (unless it is uphill of course).

Please read [the documentation](documentation/README.md) to learn how to install and use the program.
